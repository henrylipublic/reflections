it allows you to quickly zoom into the differences.

it allows you to spot changes easily, and compare to older versions when you see something wrong with your code.

pro: meaningful commits. cons: you may forget to save or commit. 

interrelated files

check versions and compare 

knowing that you can always use git checkout to see a previous version :)

not sure if I can use it for my android app?
